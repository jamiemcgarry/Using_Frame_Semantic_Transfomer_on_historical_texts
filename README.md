For those wanting to see how I coded the data shown in my essay, head first to 'Running_the_Frame_Semantic_Transformer.ipynb'. Then to see how I did the statistics head to 'Chi_sqaure_results.ipynb', and then after to see how I did the Euclidean distance meaursements head to the 'Euclidean_distance_measurement.ipynb'. Then to see how I engaged qualitiavely with the data, go to 'Qualitative_reading_and_bar_graphs.ipynb'. All the other files are csv or pkl files which holds all the data.
